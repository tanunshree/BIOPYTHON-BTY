Build a modular Python script using Biopython that performs end-to-end processing of a DNA sequence/Protein Seq file. The project will simulate a real-world bioinformatics pipeline that:

Parses input sequence data
Analyzes features
Translates DNA to protein
Aligns sequences
Visualizes outputs
Annotates genomes
Accesses biological databases.
